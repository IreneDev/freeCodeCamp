					In 1944 Hopper graduated and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I" target="_blank">the Mark I computer</a> programming staff headed by Howard H.

			<h3>Creator of First Compiler A-0</h3>

					In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation for developing <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I" target="_blank">the UNIVAC I</a>. She recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words but it was not accepted for 3 years. By 1950s, when the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation her original compiler work was done and it was known as <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-0_System" target="_blank">The A-0</a>.
