			<h3>Computer Scientist and Mathematician</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					<strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (1906 - 1992)</strong> was born in New York City in . In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics at Yale University. Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>USA Navy Rear Admiral</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					During World War II in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve, one of many women to volunteer to serve in the WAVES. She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>First Programmer of the Mark I </h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					In 1944 Hopper graduated and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as <strong>the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator</strong>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Creator of First Compiler A - O</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation for developing <strong>the UNIVAC I</strong>. She recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words but it was not accepted for 3 years. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The compiler was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>"Mother of COBOL"</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Since 1959 Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee that defined the new language <strong>COBOL</strong>. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Author of the term "debugging"</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					The Navy promotes the idea that it was Hopper that squashed the first computer bug. There is an actual

The operators affixed the moth to the computer log, with the entry: “First actual case of bug being found”. They put out the word that they had “debugged” the machine.
